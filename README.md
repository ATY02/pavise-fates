How to play on emulator:
1. Open Citra
2. Right click Fire Emblem Fates and go to 'Open Mods Location'
3. Copy romfs folder to above location
4. Profit
Note: combining this with other mods may cause either to stop working.

How to play on official 3DS:
1. I am not responsible for this mod ruining your Fates save data or your game.
2. On that note, look it up so you can blame someone other than me.

Important gameplay notes:
1. I do not recommend playing your non-Pavise-Fates save files while this mod is active.
2. Currently, the only route implemented is the Revelation route.
3. The story begins from the prologue. You should know the mod is working if you see Pavise when you enter the chapter.
4. You must play up to Branch of Fate at least once to recruit all characters and have all expected items.
5. The Partner Seal has been changed to the Pavcord Seal. This is a workaround for the game not allowing units of different genders to get classes from the Friendship Seal. So, the vast majority of units have S supports. I have not put romance into the game. THIS IS SO YOU CAN DO FUN CLASS STUFF, NOT SO YOU CAN MAKE THIS WEIRD.
6. Fewer paralogues are avilable, and at different times. Some become available as a 'postgame' after clearing Chapter 26.

Thanks for playing!
